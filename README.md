# Hex Editor Project

A project for converting different data types—binary, text, hex, and Unicode—into each other, with capabilities for searching, scrolling, deleting, and adding data.

## 1. List of identified bugs for debugging

1. Fix window size on startup
2. Correct the search count
3. Fix the up/down key behavior in search results
4. When searching in the last ten files, open a new tab
5. Fix tab indexing (closing a tab currently disrupts other features)
6. Prevent program crash when a shortcut key is pressed in the editor’s right-click context
7. Typing in text also appears on the left side
8. Delete data in the editor based on its type (e.g., 3 bytes for hex, 6 bytes for Unicode)
9. and more...

## 2. Expected features after debugging

1. Convert various data types to Hex, Unicode, Binary, and Text
2. Search within data
3. Select an entire line or select all
4. Use shortcut keys for easy access
5. Powerful file manager to open various files, folders, and drives
6. Access to the last ten opened files
7. Ability to search simultaneously across the last ten files
